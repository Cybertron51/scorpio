# cybersec-educational-tools
This project contains a scoring engine for Ubuntu OS. The scoring engine checks to see if a student has caught certain vulnerabilities on the system and provides real-time feedback on student progress. For example, if the firewall is off, then the scoring engine will reward points to the student if they turn it back on. This allows students to gain hands-on projects at securing everything from web servers to standalone workstations.
